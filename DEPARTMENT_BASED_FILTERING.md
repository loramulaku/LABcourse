# Department-Based Doctor Filtering - Implementation

## Overview

Transitioned from **specialization-based filtering** to **department-based filtering** for the public Doctors page. Now users browse doctors organized by their assigned departments instead of individual specializations.

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
**`frontend/src/pages/Doctors.jsx`**

### Key Changes

#### 1. Import API_URL
```javascript
import { API_URL } from "../api";
```

#### 2. Update URL Parameters
```javascript
// Before
const { speciality } = useParams();

// After
const { department } = useParams();
```

#### 3. Add State for Departments
```javascript
const [departments, setDepartments] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
```

#### 4. Fetch Departments on Mount
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchDepartments = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/departments`);
      if (response.ok) {
        const data = await response.json();
        setDepartments(data.data || []);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error fetching departments:", error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  fetchDepartments();
}, []);
```

#### 5. Helper Function to Get Department Name
```javascript
const getDepartmentName = (deptId) => {
  const dept = departments.find((d) => d.id === deptId);
  return dept?.name || "Unknown";
};
```

#### 6. Update Filter Logic
```javascript
// Before
const applyFilter = () => {
  if (speciality) {
    setFilterDoc(doctors.filter((doc) => doc.speciality === speciality));
  } else {
    setFilterDoc(doctors);
  }
};

// After
const applyFilter = () => {
  if (department) {
    setFilterDoc(doctors.filter((doc) => {
      const deptName = getDepartmentName(doc.department_id);
      return deptName === department;
    }));
  } else {
    setFilterDoc(doctors);
  }
};
```

#### 7. Update Filter Buttons
```javascript
// Before
{["General physician","Gynecologist","Dermatologist",...].map((spec) => (
  <p
    key={spec}
    onClick={() =>
      speciality === spec ? navigate("/doctors") : navigate(`/doctors/${spec}`)
    }
    className={`... ${speciality === spec ? "bg-[#E2E5FF]" : ""}`}
  >
    {spec}
  </p>
))}

// After
{departments.map((dept) => (
  <p
    key={dept.id}
    onClick={() =>
      department === dept.name ? navigate("/doctors") : navigate(`/doctors/${dept.name}`)
    }
    className={`... ${department === dept.name ? "bg-[#E2E5FF]" : ""}`}
  >
    {dept.name}
  </p>
))}
```

#### 8. Update Doctor Card Display
```javascript
// Before
<p className="text-[#262626] text-lg font-medium">{item.name}</p>
<p className="text-[#5C5C5C] text-sm">{item.speciality}</p>

// After
<p className="text-[#262626] text-lg font-medium">{item.User?.name || item.name}</p>
<p className="text-[#5C5C5C] text-sm">{getDepartmentName(item.department_id)}</p>
```
