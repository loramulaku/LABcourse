# âœ… New Appointment Flow - Doctor Approves First, Then Patient Pays

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Requirements Implemented

### Complete Flow:

```
1. Patient requests appointment â†’ Status: PENDING
   â†“

    â†’ Status: APPROVED
    â†’ Payment link generated (24h expiry)
    â†’ Patient receives notification with payment link
    â†“
4a. Patient pays within 24h:
    â†’ Status: CONFIRMED
    â†’ payment_status: paid
    â†’ Doctor and patient receive confirmation
    
4b. Payment not completed in 24h:
    â†’ Auto-cancelled by cron job
    â†’ Status: CANCELLED
    â†’ payment_status: expired
    â†’ Timeslot becomes available
    
3b. If REJECTED:
    â†’ Status: DECLINED

## ðŸ”§ Backend Implementation

### 1. **Modified Appointment Creation**

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/appointments/create-checkout-session`

**Old Behavior:** Created appointment + immediate payment redirect

**New Behavior:** Creates appointment request with PENDING status

**Request:**
```json
{
  "doctor_id": 8,
  "scheduled_for": "2025-11-05T14:00:00",
  "reason": "Annual checkup",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "notes": "First visit"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Appointment request submitted successfully. Waiting for doctor approval.",
  "appointment_id": 125,
  "status": "PENDING",
  "doctor_approval_required": true,
  "scheduled_for": "2025-11-05 14:00:00",
  "amount": 60.00
}
```

**Database State:**
```sql
INSERT INTO appointments (
  user_id, doctor_id, scheduled_for, reason, phone, notes, 
  amount, status, payment_status
) VALUES (
  45, 8, '2025-11-05 14:00:00', 'Annual checkup', '+1234567890', 'First visit',
  60.00, 'PENDING', 'unpaid'
);
```

// Update: APPROVED â†’ CONFIRMED + paid
await appointment.update({
  status: 'CONFIRMED',
  payment_status: 'paid',
  amount: session.amount_total / 100,
  paid_at: new Date()
});

console.log(`Appointment ${appointmentId} payment completed. Status: APPROVED -> CONFIRMED`);
// TODO: Send notifications to doctor and patient
```

**Database State After Payment:**
```sql
status: CONFIRMED
payment_status: paid
paid_at: '2025-11-02 10:45:00'
```

---

```
X-Cron-Secret: your_cron_secret_here
```

**Or Query Parameter:**

---

### Test Scenario 2: Approve â†’ No Payment â†’ Auto-Cancel

**Step 1:** Patient creates appointment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/appointments/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PATIENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "doctor_id": 8,

  }'
```

**Step 2:** Doctor approves
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/doctor/appointment/126/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DOCTOR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected:** payment_deadline = now + 24h

**Step 3:** Wait 24 hours OR manually set payment_deadline in past
```sql
UPDATE appointments SET payment_deadline = DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR) WHERE id = 126;
```

**Step 4:** Run cron job
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/appointments/cron/cancel-expired?secret=your_secret
```

**Expected:**
- Status â†’ CANCELLED
- payment_status â†’ expired
- cancelled_at timestamp set

---

### Test Scenario 3: Doctor Rejects

**Step 1:** Patient creates appointment
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/appointments/create-checkout-session \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PATIENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "doctor_id": 8,
    "scheduled_for": "2025-11-05T16:00:00",
    "reason": "Follow-up"
  }'
```

**Step 2:** Doctor rejects
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/doctor/appointment/127/reject \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer DOCTOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reason": "Unavailable at this time"
  }'
```

**Expected:**
- Status â†’ DECLINED
- rejection_reason stored
- rejected_at timestamp set
- Patient receives notification

---

## ðŸ“§ Notifications (TODO)

### 1. **Patient Submits Request**
- âœ… To Patient: "Your appointment request has been submitted. Waiting for doctor approval."

### 2. **Doctor Approves**
- âœ… To Patient: "Your appointment has been approved! Please complete payment within 24 hours."
  - Include payment link
  - Include appointment details
  - Include expiration time

### 3. **Doctor Rejects**
- âœ… To Patient: "Your appointment request was declined."
  - Include rejection reason
  - Suggest alternative actions

### 4. **Patient Pays**
- âœ… To Patient: "Payment confirmed! Your appointment is confirmed."
- âœ… To Doctor: "Patient has confirmed payment for appointment on [date]."

### 5. **Payment Expires**
- âœ… To Patient: "Your appointment was cancelled due to payment not being completed within 24 hours."
- âœ… To Doctor: "Appointment [ID] cancelled - payment expired."

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control**
- Only doctors can approve/reject appointments
- Only owner can see their appointments
- Cron endpoint requires secret key

### 2. **Appointment Ownership Verification**
```javascript
// Verify appointment belongs to doctor
const appointment = await Appointment.findOne({
  where: {
    id: id,
    doctor_id: doctorId
  }
});
```

### 3. **Stripe Session Expiration**
```javascript
expires_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (24 * 60 * 60)
```

### 4. **Cron Secret Protection**
```javascript
if (cronSecret !== process.env.CRON_SECRET) {
  return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid cron secret' });
}
```
