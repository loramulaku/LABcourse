# Complete Department Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Backend Migration
```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

This will:
- Create `departments` table
- Add `department_id` column to `doctors` table
- Add foreign key constraints and indexes

### Step 2: Seed Departments (Optional)
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 20251031_seed_departments.js
```

This creates 8 pre-populated departments:
- Cardiology
- Neurology
- Orthopedics
- Pediatrics
- General Surgery
- Emergency Medicine
- Radiology
- Psychiatry

### Step 3: Start Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test the Implementation

**Access Department Management:**
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to: Dashboard → Doctor Management → Departments
3. You should see the department management page

**Test CRUD Operations:**
1. **Create**: Click "Add Department" button
2. **Read**: Expand any department card to see details
3. **Update**: Click "Edit" button on expanded department
4. **Delete**: Click "Delete" button (requires no doctors assigned)
5. **Search**: Use search bar to filter departments

**Test Doctor Creation with Department:**
1. Go to: Dashboard → Doctor Management → Edit & Delete Doctors
2. Click "Add New Doctor"
3. Fill basic info
4. **Select Department** from dropdown (required)
5. **Specialization dropdown** will now show only that department's specializations
6. Select specialization
7. Fill remaining fields
8. Save doctor

```

### Admin-Only Endpoints
```
POST /api/departments
- Create new department
- Body: { name, description, location, phone, email, budget, specializations }

PUT /api/departments/:id
- Update department
- Body: { name, description, location, phone, email, budget, is_active, specializations }

DELETE /api/departments/:id

## Database Schema

### departments table
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  head_doctor_id INT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  budget DECIMAL(15,2),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at DATETIME,
  updated_at DATETIME,
  INDEX idx_departments_name (name),
  INDEX idx_departments_is_active (is_active)
);
```

### doctors table (updated)
```sql
ALTER TABLE doctors ADD COLUMN department_id INT;
ALTER TABLE doctors ADD FOREIGN KEY (department_id) 
  REFERENCES departments(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
ALTER TABLE doctors DROP COLUMN department;
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create Department with Specializations
1. Go to Department Management
2. Click "Add Department"
3. Fill: Name="Cardiology", Location="Building A, Floor 2"
4. Check: Cardiology specialization
5. Save
6. Verify department appears in list

### Scenario 2: Add Doctor to Department
1. Go to Doctor Management → Edit & Delete Doctors
2. Click "Add New Doctor"
3. Fill basic info (name, email, password, phone)
4. Select Department: "Cardiology"
5. Verify Specialization dropdown now shows only Cardiology specializations
6. Select Specialization: "Cardiology"
7. Fill remaining fields
8. Save
9. Verify doctor is created with department_id

### Scenario 3: Edit Doctor Department
1. Go to Doctor Management → Edit & Delete Doctors
2. Click Edit on existing doctor
3. Change Department to different one
4. Verify Specialization options update
5. Select new specialization
6. Save
7. Verify doctor's department changed

### Scenario 4: Delete Department
1. Go to Department Management
2. Expand a department
3. Click Delete
4. If department has doctors: Should show error "Cannot delete department with X doctors"
5. If department empty: Should delete successfully

### Scenario 5: Search Departments
1. Go to Department Management
2. Type in search box: "Cardio"
3. Verify only Cardiology department appears
4. Clear search
5. Verify all departments appear again

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot GET /api/departments"
**Solution**: Ensure backend is running and migration was executed
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
npm start
```

### Issue: Department dropdown empty in doctor form
**Solution**: 
1. Check if departments were seeded: `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`
2. Verify API endpoint works: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/departments`
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Specialization dropdown disabled
**Solution**: This is normal - select a department first

### Issue: Can't delete department
**Solution**: Remove all doctors assigned to that department first
- Go to Doctor Management → Edit & Delete Doctors
- Edit each doctor in that department
- Change their department
- Save
- Then delete the department

### Issue: Form won't submit
**Solution**: Ensure all required fields are filled:
- Department (required)
- Specialization (required)
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Password (for new doctors)

## Performance Notes

- Departments are fetched once on component mount
- Specializations are filtered client-side (no additional API calls)
- Indexes on `name` and `is_active` for fast queries
- Lazy-loaded components for better page load performance

---

## Security Notes

- All department endpoints require admin role
- Doctor assignment requires admin role
- Department deletion validates no doctors are assigned
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Passwords are hashed with Argon2

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Department Head**: Assign a doctor as department head
2. **Department Analytics**: Show statistics per department
3. **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple doctors to department
4. **Department Schedules**: Set operating hours
5. **Budget Tracking**: Monitor spending vs. budget
6. **Export**: Export department data to CSV/PDF

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review browser console for error messages
3. Check backend logs for API errors
4. Verify database migration was successful: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status`
