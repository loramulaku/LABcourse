# Department Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a proper Department management system to replace the string-based department field in the Doctor model. This provides better data integrity, scalability, and enables future hospital management features.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. **Created Department Model** (`backend/models/Department.js`)
- **Fields:**
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `name`: Unique department name (e.g., "Cardiology", "Neurology")
  - `description`: Department description
  - `location`: Physical location (e.g., "Building A, Floor 2")
  - `head_doctor_id`: Foreign key to the doctor who heads the department
  - `phone`: Department contact number
  - `email`: Department email
  - `budget`: Annual budget allocation
  - `is_active`: Boolean flag for active/inactive departments
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

- **Relationships:**
  - `hasMany` Doctor (one department has many doctors)
  - `belongsTo` Doctor (department can have a head doctor)

### 2. **Updated Doctor Model** (`backend/models/Doctor.js`)
- **Removed:** `department` string field
- **Added:** `department_id` foreign key (INTEGER, nullable)
- **Added Association:** `belongsTo` Department relationship
- **Benefit:** Doctors now reference departments by ID instead of storing text

### 3. **Created Migration** (`backend/migrations/20251031_add_departments.js`)
- Creates `departments` table with all fields
- Adds `department_id` column to `doctors` table
- Adds foreign key constraint with `SET NULL` on delete
- Creates indexes on `name` and `is_active` for performance
- Includes rollback functionality

### 4. **Created Department Controller** (`backend/controllers/departmentController.js`)
**Endpoints:**
- `getAllDepartments()` - Get all departments with doctors
- `getDepartmentById(id)` - Get specific department
- `createDepartment()` - Create new department (admin only)
- `updateDepartment(id)` - Update department details (admin only)
- `deleteDepartment(id)` - Delete department (admin only, with validation)
- `getDoctorsByDepartment(id)` - Get all doctors in a department
- `assignDoctorToDepartment()` - Assign/reassign doctor to department

**Features:**
- Validation for required fields
- Duplicate name prevention
- Doctor existence verification
- Prevents deletion of departments with assigned doctors
- Includes doctor count in responses

### 5. **Created Department Routes** (`backend/routes/departmentRoutes.js`)
**Public Routes:**
- `GET /api/departments` - List all departments
- `GET /api/departments/:id` - Get department details
- `GET /api/departments/:id/doctors` - Get doctors in department

**Protected Routes (Admin Only):**
- `POST /api/departments` - Create department
- `PUT /api/departments/:id` - Update department
- `DELETE /api/departments/:id` - Delete department
- `POST /api/departments/assign-doctor` - Assign doctor

### 6. **Updated Server** (`backend/server.js`)
- Imported department routes
- Registered `/api/departments` endpoint

### 7. **Created Department Seeder** (`backend/seeders/20251031_seed_departments.js`)
**Pre-populated 8 departments:**
1. Cardiology
2. Neurology
3. Orthopedics
4. Pediatrics
5. General Surgery
6. Emergency Medicine
7. Radiology
8. Psychiatry

Each with realistic details (location, contact, budget).

## How to Use

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### Step 2: Seed Departments (Optional)
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
# Or specific seeder:
npx sequelize-cli db:seed --seed 20251031_seed_departments.js
```

### Step 3: API Usage Examples

**Get all departments:**
```bash
GET /api/departments
```

**Get specific department with doctors:**
```bash
GET /api/departments/1
```

**Create new department (Admin):**
```bash
POST /api/departments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Oncology",
  "description": "Cancer treatment",
  "location": "Building D, Floor 1",
  "phone": "+1-555-0109",
  "email": "oncology@hospital.com",
  "budget": 700000.00
}
```

**Update department:**
```bash
PUT /api/departments/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Cardiology",
  "head_doctor_id": 5,
  "budget": 550000.00
}
```

**Assign doctor to department:**
```bash
POST /api/departments/assign-doctor
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "departmentId": 1,
  "doctorId": 3
}
```

**Delete department:**
```bash
DELETE /api/departments/1
```

## Benefits

✅ **Data Integrity** - Departments are controlled entities, no typos or inconsistencies

✅ **Scalability** - Easy to add department-level features (budgets, head doctors, locations)

✅ **Relationships** - Proper foreign key relationships enable complex queries

✅ **Performance** - Indexed fields allow fast lookups

✅ **Future-Ready** - Enables IPD/OPD management, ward assignment, department analytics

✅ **Validation** - Prevents orphaned departments and ensures data consistency

## Database Schema

```
departments
├── id (PK)
├── name (UNIQUE)
├── description
├── location
├── head_doctor_id (FK → doctors.id)
├── phone
├── email
├── budget
├── is_active
├── created_at
└── updated_at

doctors
├── id (PK)
├── user_id (FK)
├── department_id (FK → departments.id) ← NEW
├── specialization
├── ... other fields
└── ...
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Frontend** - Create UI for department management
2. **Update Doctor Forms** - Add department dropdown when creating/editing doctors
3. **Add Department Filtering** - Filter doctors by department on frontend
4. **Implement IPD/OPD** - Use departments for ward and bed management
5. **Add Analytics** - Department-wise revenue, doctor performance reports

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```

This will remove the migration and revert the database schema.
