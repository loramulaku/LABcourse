## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "experience field is undefined"
**Cause:** Old backend code still running
**Solution:**
```bash
cd c:\Lora\LABcourse\backend
# Kill and restart
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
npm start
```

### Issue: "about section not showing"
**Cause:** Field is empty or contains only whitespace
**Solution:** Make sure to type actual content in the About field

### Issue: "experience details not formatted"
**Cause:** Using `\n` instead of actual line breaks
**Solution:** The textarea supports multi-line. Press Enter to create line breaks.

### Issue: "Changes not saving"
**Cause:** Form validation error or backend not receiving data
**Solution:** 
- Check browser console for errors
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Verify backend is running
