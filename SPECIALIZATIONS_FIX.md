# Specializations Storage Fix

## Problem
Specializations were not being saved to the database because the `specializations` field was missing from the Department model and database schema.

## Solution
Added proper support for storing specializations as a JSON array in the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Migration File
**File:** `backend/migrations/20251031_add_specializations_to_departments.js`

Adds a `specializations` column to the departments table:
- Type: JSON
- Default: Empty array []
- Stores all specializations for each department

### 2. Updated Department Model
**File:** `backend/models/Department.js`

Added `specializations` field:
```javascript
specializations: {
  type: DataTypes.JSON,
  allowNull: true,
  defaultValue: [],
  comment: 'Array of specializations for this department',
}
```

### 3. Updated Department Controller
**File:** `backend/controllers/departmentController.js`

#### createDepartment function:
- Now accepts `specializations` from request body
- Filters out empty specializations
- Saves valid specializations to database

#### updateDepartment function:
- Now accepts `specializations` from request body
- Filters out empty specializations
- Updates specializations when editing department

## How It Works

### Creating a Department
```javascript
POST /api/departments
{
  "name": "Cardiology",
  "description": "Heart and cardiovascular diseases",
  "location": "Building A, Floor 2",
  "phone": "+1-555-0101",
  "email": "cardiology@hospital.com",
  "budget": 500000,
  "specializations": [
    "Cardiology",
    "Interventional Cardiology",
    "Electrophysiology"
  ]
}
```

**Result:** All 3 specializations are saved to the database

### Updating a Department
```javascript
PUT /api/departments/:id
{
  "specializations": [
    "Cardiology",
    "Interventional Cardiology",
    "Electrophysiology",
    "Cardiac Surgery"
  ]
}
```

**Result:** Specializations are updated to the new list

### Retrieving Departments
```javascript
GET /api/departments
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cardiology",
      "description": "Heart and cardiovascular diseases",
      "specializations": [
        "Cardiology",
        "Interventional Cardiology",
        "Electrophysiology"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run the New Migration
```bash
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

This will:
- Add `specializations` column to departments table
- Set default value to empty array

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test the Feature

**Create a Department:**
1. Go to Dashboard â†’ Doctor Management â†’ Departments
2. Click "Add Department"
3. Enter department name
4. Enter number of specializations (e.g., 3)
5. Enter specialization names:
   - Cardiology
   - Interventional Cardiology
   - Electrophysiology
6. Click "Create"

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, name, specializations FROM departments WHERE name = 'Cardiology';
```

**Result:**
```
id: 1
name: Cardiology
specializations: ["Cardiology", "Interventional Cardiology", "Electrophysiology"]
```

## Data Storage

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  location VARCHAR(255),
  head_doctor_id INT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  budget DECIMAL(15,2),
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  specializations JSON DEFAULT '[]',
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
  INDEX idx_departments_name (name),
  INDEX idx_departments_is_active (is_active)
);
```

### Example Data
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cardiology",
  "description": "Heart and cardiovascular diseases",
  "location": "Building A, Floor 2",
  "head_doctor_id": null,
  "phone": "+1-555-0101",
  "email": "cardiology@hospital.com",
  "budget": "500000.00",
  "is_active": true,
  "specializations": [
    "Cardiology",
    "Interventional Cardiology",
    "Electrophysiology"
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-10-31T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-31T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend already handles specializations correctly:

### DepartmentManagement.jsx
- Sends `specializations` array in POST/PUT requests
- Filters out empty strings
- Displays specializations as badges

### AddDoctor.jsx
- Fetches departments with specializations
- Filters specializations based on selected department
- Shows only department's specializations in dropdown

### DoctorsCrud.jsx
- Fetches departments with specializations
- Filters specializations when editing doctor
- Updates doctor with correct specialization

## Verification

### Check Migration Status
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:status
```

Should show:
```
up 20251031_add_departments.js
up 20251031_add_specializations_to_departments.js
```

### Test API Endpoint
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/departments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Should return departments with specializations array.

## Rollback (if needed)

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo
```

This will remove the `specializations` column from the database.

## Summary

âœ… Specializations are now properly stored in the database
âœ… Each department can have any number of specializations
âœ… Specializations are saved exactly as entered by admin
âœ… Frontend and backend are fully integrated
âœ… System is ready for production use

**All specializations added by the admin are now permanently saved!** ðŸŽ‰
