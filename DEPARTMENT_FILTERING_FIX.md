## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Ensure Doctors Have Departments**

First, make sure your doctors actually have `department_id` assigned:

```sql
-- Check in MySQL Workbench
SELECT 
  d.id,
  u.name AS doctor_name,
  d.department_id,
  dept.name AS department_name
FROM doctors d
JOIN users u ON d.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN departments dept ON d.department_id = dept.id;
```

**Expected Output:**
```
| id | doctor_name    | department_id | department_name |
|----|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1  | Dr. John Smith | 1             | Cardiology      |
| 2  | Dr. Jane Doe   | 2             | Neurology       |
| 3  | Dr. Bob Lee    | 1             | Cardiology      |
```

**If department_id is NULL:**
```sql
-- Quick fix: Assign all doctors to Cardiology (id=1)
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 1 WHERE department_id IS NULL;
```

---

### **Step 2: Restart Backend Server**

The backend changes need to take effect:

```bash
cd backend
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

---

### **Step 3: Test the Filtering**

1. **Open Browser DevTools (F12)**
   - Go to Console tab
   - You'll see filtering debug logs

2. **Navigate to /doctors page**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/doctors
   ```

3. **Check Console Output:**
   ```
   === FILTERING DEBUG ===
   Department filter: undefined
   Total doctors: 3
   Departments loaded: 3
   No filter - showing all doctors
   ```

4. **Click "Cardiology" button**
   - URL should change to: `/doctors/Cardiology`
   - Console should show:
   ```
   === FILTERING DEBUG ===
   Department filter: Cardiology
   Total doctors: 3
   Departments loaded: 3
   Doctor Dr. John Smith: department_id=1, deptName="Cardiology", matches=true
   Doctor Dr. Jane Doe: department_id=2, deptName="Neurology", matches=false
   Doctor Dr. Bob Lee: department_id=1, deptName="Cardiology", matches=true
   Filtered result: 2 doctors
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Only Cardiology doctors show
   - ✅ "Cardiology" button is highlighted (purple/blue)
   - ✅ Each card shows "Cardiology" under doctor name

6. **Click "Neurology" button**
   - Should show only Neurology doctors
   - Button should highlight

7. **Click "All Doctors" button**
   - Should show all doctors
   - "All Doctors" button should highlight in blue

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: No doctors show when clicking department

**Check Console Logs:**
```javascript
=== FILTERING DEBUG ===
Department filter: Cardiology
Total doctors: 3
Departments loaded: 3
Doctor Dr. John Smith: department_id=1, deptName="Unknown", matches=false
...
Filtered result: 0 doctors
```

**Problem:** `deptName` is "Unknown"
**Cause:** Doctor has `department_id` but it doesn't match any department

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if departments exist:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM departments;
```

2. **Check department IDs match:**
```sql
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.department_id,
  (SELECT name FROM departments WHERE id = d.department_id) as dept_name
FROM doctors d;
```

3. **Fix mismatched IDs:**
```sql
-- If doctor has department_id=5 but only 1,2,3 exist
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 1 WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM departments);
```

---

### Issue: "Waiting for departments to load..." forever

**Check Console:**
```javascript
Waiting for departments to load...
```

**Cause:** Departments API not returning data

**Check:**

1. **Backend is running:**
```bash
# Should see:
Server running on port 5000
```

2. **Departments endpoint works:**
```bash
# In browser or Postman:
GET http://localhost:5000/api/departments

# Should return:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Cardiology", ... },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Neurology", ... }
  ]
}
```

3. **Create departments if none exist:**
```sql
INSERT INTO departments (name, description, is_active) VALUES
('Cardiology', 'Heart and cardiovascular care', 1),
('Neurology', 'Brain and nervous system', 1),
('Orthopedics', 'Bones and joints', 1);
```

---

### Issue: Filter shows "No doctors found" but they exist

**Check Console:**
```javascript
Filtered result: 0 doctors
```

**Debugging:**

1. **Check exact department name matching:**
   - URL: `/doctors/Cardiology`
   - Department in DB: `Cardiology` (exact case match)
   - If DB has `cardiology` (lowercase), it won't match

2. **Case sensitivity fix:**
```javascript
// In Doctors.jsx, modify:
const applyFilter = () => {
  if (department) {
    const filtered = doctors.filter((doc) => {
      const deptName = getDepartmentName(doc.department_id);
      return deptName.toLowerCase() === department.toLowerCase(); // Case insensitive
    });
    ...
  }
};
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: All Doctors
```
URL: /doctors
Filter: "All Doctors" (highlighted in blue)
Display: Shows all doctors regardless of department
Console: "No filter - showing all doctors"
```

### Scenario 2: Cardiology Filter
```
URL: /doctors/Cardiology
Filter: "Cardiology" (highlighted in light purple)
Display: Only doctors with department_id matching Cardiology
Console: "Filtered result: X doctors"
Each card shows: "Cardiology" under doctor name
```

### Scenario 3: Department with No Doctors
```
URL: /doctors/Pediatrics
Filter: "Pediatrics" (highlighted)
Display: "No doctors found in this department"
Button: "Show All Doctors" to clear filter
Console: "Filtered result: 0 doctors"
```

- [ ] See "All Doctors" button at top of filter list
- [ ] See department buttons below
- [ ] Click "All Doctors" - shows all doctors, button is blue
- [ ] Click "Cardiology" - URL changes, only Cardiology doctors show
- [ ] Click "Neurology" - URL changes, only Neurology doctors show
- [ ] Click "All Doctors" again - shows all doctors
- [ ] Check browser console - no errors

## 🔧 One-Time Setup

If this is your first time testing:

### 1. Create Departments
```sql
INSERT INTO departments (name, description, is_active) VALUES
('Cardiology', 'Heart and cardiovascular care', 1),
('Neurology', 'Brain and nervous system care', 1),
('Orthopedics', 'Musculoskeletal care', 1),
('Pediatrics', 'Children healthcare', 1),
('Dermatology', 'Skin care', 1);
```

### 2. Assign Departments to Doctors
```sql
-- Assign based on specialization
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 1 WHERE specialization LIKE '%cardio%';
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 2 WHERE specialization LIKE '%neuro%';
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 3 WHERE specialization LIKE '%ortho%';

-- Or manually assign
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 1 WHERE id = 1;  -- Dr. John to Cardiology
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 2 WHERE id = 2;  -- Dr. Jane to Neurology
UPDATE doctors SET department_id = 1 WHERE id = 3;  -- Dr. Bob to Cardiology
```

### 3. Verify Setup
```sql
SELECT 
  d.id,
  u.name AS doctor,
  d.specialization,
  dept.name AS department
FROM doctors d
JOIN users u ON d.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN departments dept ON d.department_id = dept.id;
```
